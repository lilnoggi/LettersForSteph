            <p>
                Steph, if you're reading this, it means you've just received this little surprise from me!
                I made this so you can have a little piece of me with you whenever you need it.
                I hope it brings a smile to your face and reminds you how much I care about you.
                Remember, no matter where we are, I'm always thinking of you.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="sad" class="letter">
            <h2>When you're feeling sad</h2>
            <p>
                Hey Steph, I know life can be tough sometimes, and it's okay to feel sad.
                Just remember that you're not alone. I'm here for you, and I believe in you.
                You are strong, beautiful, and capable of overcoming anything that comes your way.
                Take a deep breath, and know that brighter days are ahead. I love you!
            </p>
            </div>

        <div id="miss" class="letter">
            <h2>When you miss me</h2>
            <p>
                Steph, I know there are times when you miss me, and I miss you too.
                But remember, distance is just a test of how far love can travel.
                Every moment apart is a moment closer to when we can be together again.
                Until then, keep me in your heart as I keep you in mine. I love you more than words can say!
            </p>
        </div>
